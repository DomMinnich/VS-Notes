**VS-Notes** is a simple and intuitive note-taking extension for Visual Studio Code. It allows users to create, manage, and organize notes directly within the editor. Perfect for developers who need to jot down quick ideas, to-do lists, or project-related information without leaving the VS Code environment. Notes are stored globally, so they can be accessed across all projects in your VS Code environment.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Quickly create new `.txt` notes by clicking the "New Note" button.
- **Manage Notes**: View, rename, and delete notes directly from the activity bar.
- **Quick Access**: All notes are accessible from the activity bar, making it easy to switch between your code and notes.
- **Persistent Notes**: Notes are stored globally, so they can be accessed across all projects in your VS Code environment.
- **Rename and Delete**: Click on any note to rename or delete it.

### Commands

- **New Note**: Ctr + Shift + P to bring up the command palette and type "Create A New Note" to create a new note.

## Requirements

VS-Notes does not have any external dependencies. It works out of the box in any VS Code environment, but you should be using VS Code version `1.60.0` or higher to ensure compatibility.

## Extension Settings

VS-Notes does not currently add any additional settings, but future releases may include more customizable options such as note templates or custom note directories.

## How to Use

1. **Opening the Notes Panel**: Click the VS-Notes icon in the activity bar to open the notes panel.
2. **Creating a New Note**: Click on the "New Note" button, and you'll be prompted to give the note a name.
3. **Viewing Notes**: Click on any note from the list to open it in a new tab.
4. **Renaming Notes**: Right-click on any note and choose the "Rename" option. You will be prompted to enter a new name for the note (the `.txt` extension is handled automatically).
5. **Deleting Notes**: Right-click on any note and select "Delete" to remove it from your list.

## Known Issues

- **No Multi-File Support**: Currently, each note is created as an individual `.txt` file. Future updates may include support for other file types.
- **Cross-System Compatibility**: Notes are stored in the global storage location of VS Code, meaning they're specific to the VS Code environment and not synced across different machines automatically.
